<h2>Types of programming languages<h2>
<div style="text-align:left;">
<p style="font-size:20px;"> We have numerous kinds of programming dialects and they are isolated into three gatherings . In the first place, low level, for example, machine language and Low-level computing construct. Second, centre level, for example, C, C++and Java. The last sort is the hardest one" elevated level, for example, Fortran, Pascal and Cobol. There is by all accounts a consistent intermingling as every language takes hold of thoughts that have substantiated themselves somewhere else but a persistent producing of new dialects with major contrasts in theory</p>
