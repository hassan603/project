<h2>Future of programming languages<h2>
<div style="text-align:left;">
<p style="font-size:20px;">The Language of the future for sure will borrow from both Lisp and Smalltalk but will be neither of these (nor a direct descendant).
The Language Of The Future will not be C/C++, Java, or any of the DotNet languages. The common language runtime and the Java Virtual Machine likely will be important targets in the near future, but not in the longer term.
Programming will use Dynamic Typing by default; with Type Inference performed as a performance optimization (or when improved Proof Of Correctness is needed). Manifest Typing (type annotations) will be available. For programmers who find them appropriate. In other words, it will use Soft Typing.
<br>
The Language of the future will be suitable both for Large Applications and small ones (like scripts). It will be (relatively) easy to do MetaProgramming and write Domain-Specific Languages </b>
